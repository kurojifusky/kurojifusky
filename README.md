I'm a 21-year-old unemployed self-taught [software engineer](https://furry.engineer/@kurojifusky), UI/UX designer, and a VFX artist who enjoys writing code and designing websites as a passion, my character is a [fox-husky hybrid](https://furry.engineer/@kurojifusky/110513620902455819)! I have plans to learn Arduino and a bit of embedded systems programming just for hecks.

I also make [overedited garbage](https://www.youtube.com/@kurojifusky) on YouTube!
