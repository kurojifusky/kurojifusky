Hiya! Just a fusky hybrid with a lot of talents, that I'm mostly self-thought on:
- 💻 Front-end web developer, up-and-coming Vue.js and JavaScript developer (I'm dead)
- 🎵 Indie music producer, singer/songwriter
- 🎬 Filmmaker, veteran video editor with 6 years of experience

Despite being multi-talented, I do it mostly just for the fun of it! And besides, being a self-thought is fun and a painful experience to witness lol 💜
