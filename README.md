## ðŸ¦Š About Me
Hello, my name is Kuroji Fusky! Or just Kuro for short; I'm an independent and self-taught programmer, UI/UX designer, video editor, and retired music producer. I was born in raised in the Summer Capital of the Philippines - I mostly work on my own projects just for the fun of it! I also have a decent experience in editing videos/VFX with Premiere Pro and After Effects!
