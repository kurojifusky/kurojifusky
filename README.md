Hello, I'm just 21-year-old self-taught hobbyist from the Philippines! Working on open source projects as for the fun of it! I go by my known online alias, Kuroji Fusky *(pronounced KOO-row-jee)*; a fox-husky hybrid character that acts as an extended part of me irl. I write terrible code, design UIs, make overedited videos, and produce mid music lol
