Hiya! Just a fusky hybrid with a lot of talents, born natively in the Philippines - I'm mostly self-thought on these specific fields:
- ðŸ’» Front-end web developer, beginner in Vue.js and JavaScript
- ðŸŽµ Indie music producer, singer/songwriter
- ðŸŽ¬ Filmmaker, experienced video editor
- ðŸ“¸ Photography

Despite being multi-talented, I do it mostly just for the fun of it! And besides, unless you have the ambition and the passion to make something happen, being a self-thought individual is both fun and painful experience to have and it'll be worth it in the end ðŸ’œ
