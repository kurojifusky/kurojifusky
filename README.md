Hiya! Just a fusky hybrid with a lot of talents, born natively in the Philippines - I'm mostly self-thought on these specific fields:
- 💻 Front-end web developer, beginner in Vue.js and JavaScript
- 🎵 Indie music producer, singer/songwriter
- 🎬 Filmmaker, experienced video editor
- 📸 Photography

## I build abominations

Despite being multi-talented, I do it mostly just for the fun of it! 💜
