Hiya! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¦Š Am a fusky who is a self-thought front-end web developer currently learning [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next) and [JavaScript](https://javascript.com) making terrible websites and other fun projects! Outside of programming, I'm also self-thought on these fields:
<ul>
<li> ðŸŽµ Indie music producer, singer/songwriter </li>
<li> ðŸŽ¬ Filmmaker, experienced video editor </li>
<li> ðŸ“¸ probably and a thing or two about photography </li> 
</ul>

Despite being multi-talented <s>(and a dumbass)</s>, I do it mostly just for the fun of it!
