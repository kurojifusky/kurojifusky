I'm a 21-year-old unemployed self-taught [software engineer](https://furry.engineer/@kurojifusky) who enjoys writing code and designing websites as a passion, my character is a [fox-husky hybrid](https://furry.engineer/@kurojifusky/110513620902455819)!

I also make [overedited garbage](https://www.youtube.com/@kurojifusky) and I'm planning on learning Arduino and a bit of embedded and systems programming to become the furry Michael Reeves but with the over-the-top editing lol

[P.S. No one reads this](https://blog.kurojifusky.com/)
