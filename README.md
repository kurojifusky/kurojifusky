Hello, my name is Kuroji Fusky! Or just Kuro for short; I'm a 21-year-old independent and self-taught programmer, UI/UX designer, video editor, and retired music producer. Born in raised in the Summer Capital of the Philippines - I mostly work on my own projects just for the fun of it! And, I also have a decent experience in editing videos/VFX with Premiere Pro and After Effects!

Despite graduating high school on 2021, I currently don't have a job and I'm living off YouTube revenue and Ko-fi donations.
