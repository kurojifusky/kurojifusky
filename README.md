Hiya! Just a fusky with a some set of skills mostly self-thought on these fields:
<ul>
<li> ðŸ’» Front-end web developer, beginner in Vue.js and JavaScript </li>
<li> ðŸŽµ Indie music producer, singer/songwriter </li>
<li> ðŸŽ¬ Filmmaker, experienced video editor </li>
<li> ðŸ“¸ probably and a thing or two about photography </li> 
</ul>

Despite being multi-talented <s>(and a dumbass)</s>, I do it mostly just for the fun of it! Currently focused on learning Vue.js and JavaScript for the time being!
